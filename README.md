# Android-Arduino-Java-Native-Unity
Once up on a time, I had to figure out the way for my smartphone, which host a VR game developed in Unity, to Send and Received Serial data from a connected Arduino board via OTG. I then used Java native application with function to open a serial connection, read and write data. On the Unity side, I have a C# script to load a output  .jar file.
